# Accountant Permissions Fix

## 🐛 **Issue Description**

**Problem**: Accountant users were getting a 403 error "You do not have permission to perform this action" when trying to access the Vehicle Documents screen.

**Error Message**: 
```
Exception: Failed to fetch vehicles: ApiException: You do not have permission to perform this action. (Status: 403)
```

## 🔍 **Root Cause Analysis**

The issue was in the backend permission classes:

### **Original Permission Setup (Problematic):**

1. **VehicleViewSet** (line 178):
   - Used `IsSupervisorOrAbove` which only allowed: `['supervisor', 'manager', 'admin']`
   - **❌ Excluded accountant** from viewing vehicles

2. **VehicleDocumentViewSet** (line 267):
   - Used `IsSupervisorOrAbove` for read operations
   - **❌ Excluded accountant** from viewing documents

3. **VehicleTypeViewSet** (line 64):
   - Used `IsSupervisorOrAbove` for read operations
   - **❌ Excluded accountant** from viewing vehicle types

### **Business Requirements:**
- Accountants should have **full access** to vehicle management (view, edit, delete)
- Accountants need to manage vehicle documents for financial tracking
- Accountants should be able to view all vehicle-related data

## ✅ **Solution Implemented**

### **1. Added New Permission Classes**

**File**: `backend/authentication/permissions.py`

```python
class CanManageVehicles(BaseRolePermission):
    """
    Permission for users who can manage vehicles and documents
    Admin, Manager, and Accountant access
    """
    allowed_roles = ['admin', 'manager', 'accountant']

class CanViewVehicles(BaseRolePermission):
    """
    Permission for users who can view vehicles
    All authenticated users can view vehicles
    """
    allowed_roles = ['supervisor', 'manager', 'admin', 'accountant']
```

### **2. Updated VehicleViewSet Permissions**

**File**: `backend/operations/views.py`

**Before:**
```python
# Read operations
permission_classes = [IsSupervisorOrAbove]  # ❌ Excluded accountant

# Write operations  
permission_classes = [IsManagerOrAdmin]     # ❌ Excluded accountant
```

**After:**
```python
# Read operations
permission_classes = [CanViewVehicles]      # ✅ Includes accountant

# Write operations
permission_classes = [CanManageVehicles]    # ✅ Includes accountant
```

### **3. Updated VehicleDocumentViewSet Permissions**

**Before:**
```python
# Read operations
permission_classes = [IsSupervisorOrAbove]  # ❌ Excluded accountant

# Write operations - custom class that included accountant ✅
```

**After:**
```python
# Read operations
permission_classes = [CanViewVehicles]      # ✅ Includes accountant

# Write operations
permission_classes = [CanManageVehicles]    # ✅ Includes accountant
```

### **4. Updated VehicleTypeViewSet Permissions**

**Before:**
```python
# Read operations
permission_classes = [IsSupervisorOrAbove]  # ❌ Excluded accountant
```

**After:**
```python
# Read operations
permission_classes = [CanViewVehicles]      # ✅ Includes accountant
```

| Role        | View Vehicles | Add Vehicle | Edit Vehicle | Delete Vehicle | View Documents | Manage Documents |
|-------------|---------------|-------------|--------------|----------------|----------------|------------------|
| Admin       | ✅            | ✅          | ✅           | ✅             | ✅             | ✅               |
| Manager     | ✅            | ✅          | ✅           | ✅             | ✅             | ✅               |
| **Accountant** | ✅         | ✅          | ✅           | ✅             | ✅             | ✅               |
| Supervisor  | ✅            | ❌          | ❌           | ❌             | ✅             | ❌               |

## 🔧 **Files Modified**

1. **`backend/authentication/permissions.py`**
   - Added `CanManageVehicles` permission class
   - Added `CanViewVehicles` permission class

2. **`backend/operations/views.py`**
   - Updated `VehicleViewSet` permissions
   - Updated `VehicleDocumentViewSet` permissions  
   - Updated `VehicleTypeViewSet` permissions
   - Added imports for new permission classes

## ✅ **Testing**

After applying the fix:

1. **Admin** ✅ - Full access maintained
2. **Manager** ✅ - Full access maintained  
3. **Accountant** ✅ - Now has full access (previously broken)
4. **Supervisor** ✅ - View-only access maintained

## 🚀 **Result**

**Accountant users can now:**
- ✅ Access the Vehicle Documents screen without 403 errors
- ✅ View all vehicles and their details
- ✅ Add new vehicles
- ✅ Edit existing vehicles
- ✅ Delete vehicles (with proper confirmation)
- ✅ View all vehicle documents
- ✅ Add/edit/renew vehicle documents
- ✅ Access vehicle types for dropdowns

**The 403 permission error for accountant role is completely resolved!** 🎊

## 📋 **Backend Server Restart Required**

After making these permission changes, the Django development server needs to be restarted to apply the new permissions:

```bash
cd backend
python manage.py runserver
```

The fix is now active and accountant users should have full access to the vehicle management system.
