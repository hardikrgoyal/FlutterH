# Supervisor Wallet Sidebar Fix

## 🐛 **Issue Description**

**Problem**: Wallet option was missing from the supervisor dashboard sidebar, even though the wallet functionality was available on the supervisor dashboard content.

**Error**: Supervisors could see wallet information in their dashboard but couldn't access the wallet section directly from the sidebar navigation.

## 🔍 **Root Cause Analysis**

The issue was in the sidebar navigation configuration:

### **Sidebar Navigation Missing Wallet:**

**File**: `frontend/lib/shared/widgets/app_drawer.dart`

**Problem**: The supervisor role section (lines 447-496) was missing the wallet navigation item, while other roles had it:

- ✅ **Admin** had "Wallet" (lines 268-275)
- ✅ **Manager** had "Wallet" (lines 400-407)
- ✅ **Accountant** had "Wallet Management" (lines 520-527)
- ❌ **Supervisor** was missing wallet navigation

### **Dashboard Already Had Wallet:**

**File**: `frontend/lib/features/dashboard/dashboard_screen.dart`

**Confirmed**: The supervisor dashboard already included wallet functionality:
- Line 179: `_buildWalletSection(context, ref),`

So the functionality existed but was just missing from the navigation menu.

## ✅ **Solution Implemented**

### **Added Wallet Navigation for Supervisor**

**File**: `frontend/lib/shared/widgets/app_drawer.dart`

**Added the following navigation item to the supervisor role section:**

```dart
{
  'title': 'Wallet',
  'icon': Icons.account_balance_wallet,
  'color': AppColors.success,
  'onTap': () {
    Navigator.pop(context);
    context.go('/wallet');
  },
},
```

**Position**: Added after "Labour Costs" and before "Work Orders" to maintain logical grouping.

## 🎯 **Sidebar Navigation After Fix**

### **Supervisor Sidebar Menu:**

1. 🏠 **Dashboard**
2. 📄 **Vehicle Documents**
3. 🏗️ **Equipment**
4. 📊 **Equipment History**
5. 👥 **Labour Costs**
6. 💰 **Wallet** ✅ ← **NEW**
7. 🔧 **Work Orders**
8. 🛒 **Purchase Orders**

## 🔧 **Files Modified**

1. **`frontend/lib/shared/widgets/app_drawer.dart`**
   - Added wallet navigation item to supervisor role section
   - Positioned between Labour Costs and Work Orders
   - Uses same icon and color scheme as other roles
   - Routes to `/wallet` path

## ✅ **Testing**

### **Verification Steps:**

1. **Login as Supervisor** ✅
2. **Open Sidebar** ✅
3. **See Wallet Option** ✅
4. **Click Wallet** ✅
5. **Navigate to Wallet Screen** ✅

### **Cross-Role Verification:**

| Role | Wallet in Sidebar | Wallet Path |
|------|------------------|-------------|
| Admin | ✅ | `/wallet` |
| Manager | ✅ | `/wallet` |
| **Supervisor** | ✅ | `/wallet` |
| Accountant | ✅ | `/wallet-management` |

## 🚀 **Result**

**Supervisor users can now:**
- ✅ Access the Wallet section directly from the sidebar
- ✅ Navigate to wallet functionality without going through dashboard
- ✅ Have consistent navigation experience with other roles
- ✅ Maintain all existing wallet functionality on dashboard

**The supervisor wallet sidebar navigation issue is completely resolved!** 🎊

## 📋 **Notes**

- No backend changes required - this was purely a frontend navigation issue
- Wallet functionality was already available for supervisors in the dashboard
- The route `/wallet` was already configured and working
- This maintains consistency with admin and manager wallet navigation
