### 🔧 **Implementation Details**

#### **Files Created/Modified:**

   - Complete edit form based on add vehicle screen
   - Pre-populates all fields with existing vehicle data
   - Same validation logic and user experience

2. **Modified**: `vehicle_documents_screen.dart`
   - Added popup menu with edit/delete options to vehicle cards
   - Role-based visibility of action menu
   - Integrated edit and delete workflows

3. **Modified**: `vehicle_detail_screen.dart`
   - Added edit/delete options to app bar
   - Role-based visibility of actions

#### **Role Check Implementation:**
```dart
final canEdit = user?.role == 'admin' || user?.role == 'manager' || user?.role == 'accountant';
```

#### **UI Integration:**
```dart
// Vehicle card actions menu (only shown if canEdit)
if (canEdit) ...[
  const SizedBox(width: 8),
  _buildVehicleActionsMenu(vehicle),
],

// App bar actions (only shown if canEdit)
actions: canEdit ? [
  PopupMenuButton<String>(
    // Edit/Delete options
  ),
] : null,
```

### 📱 **User Experience**

#### **For Authorized Roles (Admin/Accountant/Manager):**

1. **Vehicle List View**:
   - **Three-dot menu** appears on each vehicle card
   - **Edit**: Opens pre-filled edit form
   - **Delete**: Shows confirmation dialog

2. **Vehicle Detail View**:
   - **Three-dot menu** in app bar
   - **Edit**: Opens pre-filled edit form
   - **Delete**: Shows confirmation dialog

3. **Edit Vehicle Flow**:
   - **Tap Edit** → Opens edit screen with all fields pre-filled
   - **Make changes** → Form validates inputs
   - **Save** → Shows success message and returns to previous screen

4. **Delete Vehicle Flow**:
   - **Tap Delete** → Shows confirmation dialog with warning
   - **Confirm** → Deletes vehicle and all documents
   - **Shows success message** and refreshes vehicle list

#### **For Other Roles:**
- **No edit/delete options** visible anywhere
- **View-only access** to all vehicle information
- **Clean UI** without unnecessary action buttons

### 🛡️ **Safety Features**

#### **Delete Confirmation Dialog:**
```dart
AlertDialog(
  title: const Text('Delete Vehicle'),
  content: Column(
    children: [
      Text('Are you sure you want to delete vehicle "${vehicle.vehicleNumber}"?'),
      const Text(
        'This action cannot be undone. All associated documents will also be deleted.',
        style: TextStyle(color: AppColors.error, fontWeight: FontWeight.w500),
      ),
    ],
  ),
  // Cancel and Delete buttons
)
```

#### **Backend Safety:**
- ✅ **Cascade Delete**: Django models handle document deletion automatically
- ✅ **Database Constraints**: Ensures data integrity during deletion
- ✅ **Transaction Safety**: Delete operations are atomic

### 🔄 **State Management**

#### **List Refresh:**
```dart
// Refresh vehicle list after edit/delete
ref.refresh(vehiclesProvider(_filters));

// Navigation with refresh signal
Navigator.pop(context, true);
```

#### **Error Handling:**
```dart
try {
  await vehicleService.updateVehicle(id, data);
  // Success feedback
} catch (e) {
  // Error feedback with specific message
  ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
    SnackBar(content: Text('Failed to update vehicle: $e')),
  );
}
```
