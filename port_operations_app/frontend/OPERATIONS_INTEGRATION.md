# Operations Management Integration

## Overview
The operations management system has been successfully connected to the backend API, providing full CRUD operations for managing cargo operations in the Port Operations Management App.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Backend API Integration
- **Operations Service** (`operations_service.dart`): Complete API integration with Django backend
- **CargoOperation Model** (`cargo_operation_model.dart`): JSON serializable model matching backend structure
- **State Management**: Riverpod-based state management for operations
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user feedback
- **Loading States**: Proper loading indicators during API operations

### 2. Operations Management Features
- **List Operations**: Fetch and display all cargo operations with pagination support
- **Create Operation**: Add new cargo operations with comprehensive form validation
- **Filter Operations**: Filter by status (pending, ongoing, completed)
- **Search Operations**: Search by operation name, party name, or packaging
- **Real-time Stats**: Display counts for total, pending, ongoing, and completed operations
- **Refresh**: Pull-to-refresh functionality

### 3. User Interface Components
- **Operations Screen**: Updated to use real API data instead of demo data
- **Create Operation Screen**: Beautiful form with validation for all required fields
- **Status Cards**: Real-time statistics from backend data
- **Filter Chips**: Interactive status filtering
- **Search Dialog**: Advanced search functionality
- **Error States**: Proper error handling with retry functionality
- **Loading States**: Professional loading indicators

### 4. Data Model Structure
The CargoOperation model includes:
- `id`: Unique identifier
- `operation_name`: Operation name (e.g., BREAKBULK-001)
- `date`: Operation date
- `cargo_type`: Type of cargo (breakbulk, container, bulk, project, others)
- `weight`: Weight in metric tons
- `packaging`: Description of packaging
- `party_name`: Client/party name
- `project_status`: Status (pending, ongoing, completed)
- `remarks`: Optional remarks
- `created_by`: Creator user ID
- `created_by_name`: Creator username
- `created_at`/`updated_at`: Timestamps

### 5. Form Validation
The create operation form includes comprehensive validation:
- **Operation Name**: Required, unique identifier
- **Date**: Date picker with reasonable date range
- **Cargo Type**: Dropdown with predefined options
- **Weight**: Required, numeric validation
- **Packaging**: Required description
- **Party Name**: Required client information
- **Status**: Default to "pending" with option to change
- **Remarks**: Optional additional information

## API Endpoints Used

### Operations Management
- `GET /api/operations/cargo-operations/` - List all operations with filtering
- `POST /api/operations/cargo-operations/` - Create new operation
- `GET /api/operations/cargo-operations/{id}/` - Get specific operation
- `PATCH /api/operations/cargo-operations/{id}/` - Update operation
- `DELETE /api/operations/cargo-operations/{id}/` - Delete operation

### Query Parameters
- `status`: Filter by project status (pending, ongoing, completed)
- `cargo_type`: Filter by cargo type (breakbulk, container, bulk, project, others)

## Security & Permissions
- **Role-based Access**: Only managers and admins can create operations
- **JWT Authentication**: All API calls use JWT tokens
- **Permission Checks**: Backend enforces `CanCreateOperations` permission

## Current Status
✅ **Operations Listing**: Fully functional with real backend data
✅ **Operations Creation**: Complete form with validation and API integration
✅ **Filtering & Search**: Working status filters and search functionality
✅ **Statistics**: Real-time operation counts from backend
✅ **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error states and retry mechanisms
✅ **Loading States**: Professional loading indicators
✅ **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first design with proper UI/UX

## Demo Data Available
The backend contains 3 demo operations:
1. **BREAKBULK-001** - ABC Steel Industries (Ongoing)
2. **CONTAINER-002** - XYZ Logistics (Pending)
3. **PROJECT-003** - Industrial Corp (Completed)

## Next Steps
The operations management system is now fully operational. Potential enhancements:
1. **Operation Details View**: Individual operation detail screens
2. **Operation Editing**: Edit existing operations
3. **Bulk Operations**: Multiple operation management
4. **Advanced Filtering**: More filter options (date range, party name, etc.)
5. **Export/Import**: CSV/Excel export functionality
6. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for live updates

## Technical Notes
- Uses `json_annotation` for JSON serialization
- Implements proper state management with Riverpod
- Follows Flutter best practices for form handling
- Includes proper error boundaries and loading states
- Mobile-optimized UI with Material Design 3 components
