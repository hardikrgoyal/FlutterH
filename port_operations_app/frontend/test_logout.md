# Logout Functionality Test Plan

## Test Steps:
1. ✅ Login with any user (admin, manager, supervisor, accountant)
2. ✅ Navigate to any screen (dashboard, equipment, etc.)
3. ✅ Open the drawer menu
4. ✅ Click on "Logout" button
5. ✅ Confirm logout in the dialog
6. 🔍 **Verify**: Loading indicator appears
7. 🔍 **Verify**: User is redirected to login screen
8. 🔍 **Verify**: User data is cleared (no auto-login)
9. 🔍 **Verify**: Attempting to navigate to protected routes redirects to login

## Debug Information to Check:
- Console logs starting with 🔓 (AuthService logout process)
- Console logs starting with 🔄 (Router refresh notifications)
- Console logs starting with 🛣️ (Router redirect logic)

## Expected Behavior:
```
🔓 AuthService: Clearing tokens...
🔓 AuthService: Tokens cleared
🔓 AuthService: User data cleared
🔓 Auth service logout completed
🔓 Auth state reset completed
🔄 Router refresh: Auth state changed - isLoggedIn: true -> false
🔄 Router refresh: Notifying listeners
🛣️ Router redirect: path=/dashboard, isLoggedIn=false, isLoading=false
🛣️ Router redirect: Not logged in, redirecting to login
```

## Alternative Testing:
If automatic redirect fails, test manual navigation to protected routes to ensure they redirect to login.
